System design notes for TinyURL with a few implementations in Rust, TypeScript, and others to come.

## Overview

I had an interview question on how to implement TinyURL. I realize that the design of TinyURL is a popular system design interview question, but after this, it seems like a pretty good coding question as well. I happened to do the first cut in node, but I am trying it out in rust now. Maybe some others to come.
